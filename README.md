I'm a fast paced semi-perfectionist with close attention to detail and a knack for finding creative solutions. With my experience in the service industry I learned to excel in fast paced high output work while also making sure the most minute things are perfect. 
  Always having a gaming system from a young age, I learned to think quick on my feet and developed creative problem solving skills. I pick up on new concepts fast and work well with others, and work well in either static or dynamic work environments.
